        // Similarly, we must explicitly set serviceName if it cannot be derived from the domainSimpleName using normal conventions.

    // In general, our controllers will support only RESTful clients for integration purposes, and will
    // not have non-RESTful actions like 'index' or 'view'.

        // handled by the corresponding 'Composer'.  This is the +only+ action supporting the ZK based user interface.
