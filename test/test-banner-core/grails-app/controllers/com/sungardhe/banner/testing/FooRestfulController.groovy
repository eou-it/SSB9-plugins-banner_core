    // The following actions are here solely to illustrate that additional actions can be implemented here.
    // In general, our controllers will support only RESTful clients for integration purposes, and will
    // not have non-RESTful actions like 'index' or 'view'.

    def view = {
        render "If I had a UI, I'd render it now!"
        // Render the main ZUL page supporting this model.  All subseqent requests from this UI will be 
        // handled by the corresponding 'Composer'.  This is the +only+ action supporting the ZK based user interface.
        // The other actions in this controller support RESTful clients. 
    }
                

    // ------------------------------------ Custom Renderer --------------------------------------

    // Developer note:
    // Closures that are returned to perform custom rendering must be applicable to the current request format.
    // The closure returned by this method may be able to support multiple formats or just a single format, but
    // it is the responsibility of this method to return an applicable renderer for the current request.
    // The returned closures are also responsible for setting the appropriate format on the response. They need not
    // set the HTTP status unless it needs to be overridden.
    // If the getCustomRenderer() returns null, default rendering will be used. This method should return a
    // closure only when custom rendering is needed and supported -- otherwise it should return null.
    // If a controller does not require any custom rendering, this method may be removed completely.
    public Closure getCustomRenderer( String actionName ) {
        // While this method currently doesn't return any closures, it is implemented here solely for testing of the
        // framework (by recording this invocation in the 'invokedRenderCallbacks' list for which tests can assert content. 
        log.trace "getCustomRenderer() invoked with actionName $actionName and will return null"
        invokedRenderCallbacks << actionName
        null
