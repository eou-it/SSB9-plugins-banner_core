    // set the HTTP status unless it needs to be overriden.
    // If the getCustomRenderer() returns null, default rendering will be used. This method should return a
    // closure only when custom rendering is needed and supported -- otherwise it should return null.

    // accept partial XML fragments containing only the information needed to satisfy the request.  
    // For example, to update the foo description, the XML need only populate the description element.
