/**
 * Controller supporting the 'Foo' model that relies on mixed-in RESTful CRUD methods.
 * Note that the actions used to expose a RESTful interface are provided by the RestfulControllerMixin class,
 * which is mixed in at runtime during bootstrap (see BannerCoreGrailsPlugin.groovy).
 *
 * Developer note: A minimal RESTful controller may consist of only two lines:
 *     static List mixInRestActions = [ 'show', 'list', 'create', 'update', 'destroy' ]
 *     def xyzService // injected by Spring
 * These two lines will provide a functioning RESTful controller using default Grails converters
 * for parsing and rendering.

class FooController  {

    // The mixInRestActions lists actions that will be mixed into this class and that will be registered with the corresponding Grails 'artefact'.
    // Note that all REST actions implemented by RestfulControllerMixin will be mixed-in, only those specified here will
    // be registered with the artefact (so that URL mapping will be allowed only to these actions).

        // serviceName = "fooService" // explicitly set only when not following normal grails naming conventions
    }


    // ---------------------------- User Interface Actions (non-RESTful) ----------------------------------
    // The following actions are here solely to illustrate that additional actions can be implemented here.
    // In general, our controllers will support RESTful clients for integration purposes, and will
    // not usually have non-RESTful actions like 'index' or 'view' below.  It IS possible to invoke the mixed-in
    // actions non-restfully if necessary (i.e., by using a URL that specifies the action name).


    // in case someone uses a URI explicitly indicating 'index' or our URI mapping includes a non-RESTful mapping to 'index'
    // Otherwise, this would never be called (as a GET using a URI without explicitly specifying 'index' would result in
    // a RESTful 'GET' of the resource using a 'show' mixed-in action.
    def index = {
        redirect( action: "view", params: params )
    }


    // Render content (e.g., HTML)  -- note that ALL other actions are provided by the base class. :-)
    def view = {
        render "If I had a UI, I'd render it now!"
        // Render a UI supporting this model.  All subsequent requests from this UI will be
        // handled by the corresponding 'Composer'.  This is the +only+ action supporting the ZK based user interface.
        // The other actions in this controller support RESTful clients.
    }


    // ------------------------------------ Custom Representation Support Methods --------------------------------------


    // Developer note:
    //
    // Support for custom resources may be implemented explicitly within your controller by implementing 'getCustomRepresentationBuilder'
    // and 'getParamsExtractor' methods as shown below.
    //
    // Note that generally, it will be best to implement custom representation support outside of this controller, by specifying
    // the custom handling within the representationHandlerMap map contained in Config.groovy or the customRepresentationHandlerMap
    // map contained in the CustomRepresentationConfig.groovy file.  Configuring custom representation support within these
    // configuration files will ensure this support is registered within the ResourceRepresentationRegistry registry.
    //
    // The ResourceRepresentationRegistry is used by the mixed-in RESTful actions to attain custom representation support, and
    // only if it cannot be found will this controller be given the opportunity to provide the support. This allows externalized
    // configuration to 'override' any hardcoded implementation contained in a controller.
    //
    // A controller may provide explicit (hardcoded) support for a custom representation by implementing the two methods below.
    // Please read the RestfulControllerMixin.groovy class javadoc for details regarding the use of these methods.
    //
    /**
     * Returns a RepresentationBuilder that can create an appropriate representation for a resource, or null if no support for a needed
     * representation is available.
