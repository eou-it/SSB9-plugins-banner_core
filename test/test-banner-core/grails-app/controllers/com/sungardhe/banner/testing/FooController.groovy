/**
 * Controller supporting the 'Foo' model that relies on mixed-in RESTful CRUD methods.
 * Note that the actions used to expose a RESTful interface are provided by the RestfulControllerMixin class,
 * which is mixed in at runtime during bootstrap (see BannerCoreGrailsPlugin.groovy).
 *
 * Developer note: A minimal RESTful controller may consist of only two lines:
 *     static List mixInRestActions = [ 'show', 'list', 'create', 'update', 'destroy' ]
 *     def xyzService // injected by Spring
 * These two lines will provide a functioning RESTful controller using default Grails converters
 * for parsing and rendering.

class FooController  {

    // The mixInRestActions lists actions that will be mixed into this class and that will be registered with the corresponding Grails 'artefact'.
    // Note that all REST actions implemented by RestfulControllerMixin will be mixed-in, only those specified here will
    // be registered with the artefact (so that URL mapping will be allowed only to these actions).
    static List mixInRestActions = [ 'show', 'list', 'create', 'update', 'destroy' ]

    // ---------------------------- User Interface Actions (non-RESTful) ----------------------------------
    // The following actions are here solely to illustrate that additional actions can be implemented here.
    // In general, our controllers will support only RESTful clients for integration purposes, and will
    // not have non-RESTful actions like 'index' or 'view'.  It IS possible to invoke the mixed-in actions
    // non-restfully if necessary (i.e., by using a URL that specifies the action name).


    // in case someone uses a URI explicitly indicating 'index' or our URI mapping includes a non-RESTful mapping to 'index'
    def index = {
        redirect( action: "view", params: params )
    }


    // Render main User Interface page -- note that ALL other actions are provided by the base class. :-)
    def view = {
        render "If I had a UI, I'd render it now!"
        // Render the main ZUL page supporting this model.  All subseqent requests from this UI will be
        // handled by the corresponding 'Composer'.  This is the +only+ action supporting the ZK based user interface.
        // The other actions in this controller support RESTful clients.
    }


    // ------------------------------------ Custom Representation Support Methods --------------------------------------


    /**
     * Returns a Closure that can create an appropriate representation for a resource, or null if no support for a needed
     * representation is available.
     * @param actionName the controller action for which a custom representation is needed for rendering
     * @return Closure a closure that can create an appropriate representation of a resource, so that it can be subsequently rendered
     */
    // Developer note:
    // Closures that are returned which can create a custom representation must be applicable for the current request content type.
    // The closure returned by this method may be able to support multiple content types or just a single content type, but
    // it is the responsibility of this method to return a closure that can create a representation applicable for the current request.
    //
    // If the getCustomRepresentationBuilder() returns null, the mixed-in action will attempt to retrieve custom representation support
    // from the ResourceRepresentationRegistry. If the registry cannot provide a closure appropriate for the current request, the
    // mixed-in action will simply render a default representation (using standard Grails Converters), for XML or JSON.
    //
    // Note that registering custom support within the ResourceRepresentationRegistry (via Spring configuration) may likely preclude
    // any need to implement this method or to modify this method as new representations are needed.
    // If neither the registry nor this controller can provide support for a needed representation, the mixed-in action will
    // use default Grails rendering.
    //
    public Closure getCustomRepresentationBuilder( String actionName ) {
        log.trace "getCustomRepresentationBuilder() invoked with actionName $actionName, and the request format is ${request.getHeader( 'Content-Type' )}"

        // not normally present, this is used solely for testing the framework.  Custom renderers for Foo are registered
        // in the ResourceRepresentationRegistry instead of here, so this method will return null.  If we didn't need
        // the 'invokedRenderCallbacks' list for testing, we would have ommitted this method completely.
        invokedRenderCallbacks << actionName
        return null
    }


    // --------------------------- Special 'params' handling & Rendering ---------------------------


    // We'll return a closure for any specific content type formats that we explicitly support.
    // If we don't return a closure, or if we don't even expose an 'extractParams' method at all,
    // the base class will check Spring for a registered handler class, and lastly will fall back to
    // it's default param extraction.
    //
    public Closure getParamsExtractor() {
        return null  // we'll return null -- alternatively, we could have ommitted this method completely
