// NOTE:
// This service is injected with create, update, and delete methods.
// These injected CRUD methods may throw a runtime ApplicationException that should
// be caught (e.g., by a controller using this service). In addition to handling
// ApplicationException, controllers should also catch Exception to ensure a desirable
// response is still provided to the user. Exceptions other than ApplicationException 
// are likely programming errors (as they were not wrapped in an ApplicationException).

// Please review ApplicationException and it's integration test for details on handling
// exceptions. The FooController in this project illustrates use of ApplicationException 
// functionality.
