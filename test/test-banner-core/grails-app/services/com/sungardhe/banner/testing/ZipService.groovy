// DEVELOPER NOTE:
// Basic CRUD methods (create, update, delete, list, count) methods are provided by the ServiceBase
// service.  Services may either extend ServiceBase or may mixin ServiceBzse (using the Mixin annotation).
// For backward compatibility with a previous 'method injection based appraoch', the mixin
// will also be mixed in if there is a 'static defaultCrudMethds = true' line.
//
// When 'mixing in' ServiceBase versus extending from it, @Transactional annotations are not effective.
// Consequently, if using @Mixin or including 'static defaultCrudMethods = false' (which will cause the ServiceBase
// to be mixed in dynamically during bootstrap), you must also include 'static transactional = true' to ensure
// your service is transactional.  If you extend ServiceBase, you should omit 'static transactional = true' as
// the @Transactional annotations in the ServiceBase are effective. @Transactional annotations provide more
// control as each method may be annotated, and each annotation may specify it's own transaction attributes.
//
// The ServiceBase CRUD methods may throw a runtime ApplicationException that should
// be caught (e.g., by a controller using this service). In addition to handling
// ApplicationException, controllers/composers should also catch Exception to ensure a desirable
// response is still provided to the user. Exceptions other than ApplicationException 
// are likely programming errors (as they were not wrapped in an ApplicationException).

// Please review ApplicationException and it's integration test for details on handling
// exceptions. The FooController in this project illustrates use of ApplicationException 
// functionality.

// @Mixin( ServiceBase ) // Commented out, as we'll extend from ServiceBase in order to use @Transactional methods
class ZipService extends ServiceBase {

    // There are THREE ways to mixin ServiceBase -- either by extending it (the preferred approach), mixing it
    // in using the @Mixin annotation or mixing it in dynamically by including the following
    // 'static defaultCrudMethods = true' line.  (As discussed above, mixing in ServiceBase precludes use of
    // @Transactianal annotations, and is thus not preferred.)
    //
    // static defaultCrudMethods = true

    // The following line would be required if we were mixing in ServiceBase. In this case we are extending from it
    // and thus it's @Transactional annotations are effective (precluding the need for using this static boolean)
    //
    // static transactional = true

    // Note: You MUST set the domainClass IF you are not following normal naming conventions where the
    // domain name is the same as the service name (minus the trailing 'Service' portion).  Since in this case,
    // our domain name is 'Foo' and our service is 'FooService', the domainClass can be determined.
    //
    // Class domainClass = Foo 

    // When creating your own access/query methods, if you are extending ServiceBase you should specify a 'read-only'
    // transaction, as in the following annotation. This will be slightly more performant than using the static transactional = true
    // approach (where all methods would not be read-only, increasing Hibernate overhead.
    //
    // Note that for a simple service, with no additional methods like the one below, the body of the class would be completely empty.
    //
