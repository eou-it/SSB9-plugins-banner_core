// NOTE: This implementation holds the Banner password that must be used 
// to unlock the role associated to this authority.  This appraoch was 
// taken since the view used to query for a users authorities includes the 
// passwords for those roles.  This appraoch stores role password data redundantly
// for each user, but also has benefits of needing to hold only those passwords 
// actively used by a logged in user. It also doesn't require special cache 
// handling if this data were centralized and cached for the entire application. 
// Regardless, this note is here as an indicator that we may want to revist this appraoch.
