/**
 * A class-level annotation that may be used to indicate that the database may 
 * modify the state of the annotated model after a save. This occurs with models
 * that are backed by APIs (including those backed by views that have instead of 
 * triggers that delegate to APIs). Banner APIs set the 'activity date' and ignore the 
 * lastModified property value set via the 'AuditTrailPropertySupportHibernateListener'
 * hibernate listener.  This annotation is used by 'ServiceBase', so that services 
 * that extend or mixin ServiceBase will automatically refresh the model after a save.
 * If this refresh is not performed, the model will not reflect what is actually persisted.
